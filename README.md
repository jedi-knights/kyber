kyber walks a Go codebase, parses every function, and scores each one against a registered set of code-quality metrics. Output is human-readable text, machine-readable JSON, or SARIF v2.1.0 for GitHub code scanning.

```
$ kyber analyze ./internal/adapters/parser/...

internal/adapters/parser/goast.go
                         mi cog cyc   diff     effrt fln      hal nst npth  read ret   tst
  New                 88.41   0   1      6    259.11   1    43.19   1    1  0.68   1  0.99
  GoAST.ParseFiles   51.03!   5   5 20.14! 14073.98!  18   698.81   3   12 0.31!   4 0.53!
  parseFiles         49.65!   7   5 20.57! 22623.65!  20 1099.76!   3    9 0.38!   4 0.39!

[PACKAGE MEANS]
  internal/adapters/parser   mi=59.84 cog=3.47 cyc=3.53 diff=15.24 effrt=9043.43 ... (15 fns)

[OVERALL]
  mi=67.13 cog=2.17 cyc=2.84 read=0.52 tst=0.73 ... (241 fns)

Functions: 241   Findings: 521   Files: 33   Time: 27ms
```

Each row is an aligned table: the header line shows compact metric labels (`mi`, `cog`, `cyc`, …), and every value below sits in the same column. Maintainability Index (`mi`) is promoted to the leftmost metric column because it's the only single-number composite. A `!` glued to a value means the score crossed its threshold.

The architecture is built around a single `Metric` interface. Adding a new metric (nesting depth, parameter count, fan-out, etc.) is one new file in `internal/domain/metrics/` plus one registration line — nothing else needs to change.

## Why kyber?

Existing Go linters (`golangci-lint`, `gocyclo`, `revive`) enforce per-rule thresholds across an entire codebase. They tell you which lines violate a rule; they do not tell you which functions are healthy, mediocre, or risky overall. kyber works at the **function level**, producing per-function scores so you can:

- See at a glance which functions in a package carry the most quality risk
- Track readability and testability over time, not just complexity
- Plug a new metric into the same scoring pipeline without writing another linter

## Installation

### Go install (recommended for Go developers)

Requires Go 1.23 or later.

```bash
# Latest release
go install github.com/jedi-knights/kyber/cmd/kyber@latest

# Pinned to a specific version
go install github.com/jedi-knights/kyber/cmd/kyber@v0.1.0

# HEAD of main (unstable; pre-release work)
go install github.com/jedi-knights/kyber/cmd/kyber@main
```

`go install` places the binary in `$GOBIN` if set, otherwise in `$GOPATH/bin` (default: `$HOME/go/bin`). Make sure that directory is on your `PATH`:

```bash
# bash / zsh — append to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"
```

Verify the install:

```bash
$ kyber version
v0.1.0

$ kyber list-metrics

npath            NPath Complexity        200      higher is worse  Nejmeh NPath — acyclic execution paths (multiplicative).
readability      Readability Score       0.6      lower is worse   Weighted 0–1 score from length, nesting, identifier length, comments.
returns          Return Statement Count  4        higher is worse  Number of return statements anywhere in the function body.
testability      Testability Score       0.6      lower is worse   Weighted 0–1 score from parameter count, side effects, interface params, length.
```

When you install a tagged release this way, `kyber version` reports the tag automatically — kyber reads its module version from the embedded build info.

All twelve are configurable per-project via `kyber.toml`. See [Configuration](#configuration).

To run only specific metrics, pass `--metric=<id>` (repeatable). To exclude metrics, pass `--disable=<id>` (also repeatable). The examples in each subsection below use `--metric` to keep the output focused on one column at a time.

### Cyclomatic Complexity

**Counts**: independent paths through a function — adds one for every `if`, `for`, `range`, non-default `case`, non-default `select` clause, and short-circuit boolean operator (`&&`, `||`).

**Formula**: `1 + decision_points`.

**How to read it**: 1 is a straight-line function; 5–7 is typical for branching logic; above 7 is a candidate for extraction. Cyclomatic alone misses *nesting* — a function with seven sequential `if` blocks scores the same as one with seven-deep nesting.

**Example**:

```bash
$ kyber analyze --metric=cyclomatic ./testdata/complex/

testdata/complex/complex.go
  Branchy   cyclomatic=12 !
```

**Reference**: McCabe, T. J. (1976). [*A Complexity Measure*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity). IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.

### Cognitive Complexity

**Counts**: control structures weighted by nesting depth, plus boolean-operator transitions. Each `if`/`for`/`switch`/`select` adds `1 + nesting_level`; `else` and `else if` each add 1 without the nesting penalty; sequences of like boolean operators (`&&` or `||`) add 1 per sequence with one more per operator change inside; labeled `break`/`continue`/`goto` each add 1; nested function literals increase the nesting level for their bodies.

**Formula**: walks the AST applying the rules above; no single closed-form expression.

**How to read it**: SonarQube's default per-function warning is 15. A function scoring close to its cyclomatic value has flat branching; a function scoring much higher than its cyclomatic (e.g. cyclomatic 4, cognitive 10) has deeply nested branching and is the primary type cognitive complexity is designed to catch.

**Example** — the `nested` fixture has four-deep nesting; cognitive is 10 (below the threshold but well above the same function's cyclomatic of 4):

```bash
$ kyber analyze --metric=cognitive ./testdata/nested/

testdata/nested/nested.go
  Nested   cognitive=10
```

**Reference**: Campbell, G. A. (2018). *Cognitive Complexity — A new way of measuring understandability*. [SonarSource white paper (PDF)](https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf).

### NPath Complexity

**Counts**: number of acyclic execution paths through the function. Where cyclomatic adds decision points, NPath multiplies them — `if-else` contributes `paths(then) + paths(else)`, sequential statements multiply, loops contribute `paths(body) + 1`, switch contributes the sum of its cases.

**Formula**: recursive walk of the AST applying the rules above; no single closed-form expression. Logical operators (`&&`, `||`) inside conditions each add 1 path.

**How to read it**: 1 is a straight-line function; 8 is three sequential if-else blocks; values explode quickly past 200 (the standard yellow flag) because the count is multiplicative. A function with cyclomatic 8 but NPath 256 has the same number of decision points as a flat structure but stacks them — that's the case NPath is designed to catch.

**Example** — three sequential if-else blocks yield 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 paths:

```bash
$ kyber analyze --metric=npath ./testdata/npath_branchy/

testdata/npath_branchy/main.go
  Triple   npath=8
```

**Reference**: Nejmeh, B. A. (1988). [*NPATH: A measure of execution path complexity and its applications*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/42372.42379). Communications of the ACM, 31(2).

### Halstead Volume

**Counts**: every token in the function body, classified as an operator (keywords, punctuation, operators) or operand (identifiers, literals). Tracks `n1`, `n2` (unique operators/operands) and `N1`, `N2` (total counts).

**Formula**: `V = N × log₂(n)` where `N = N1 + N2` and `n = n1 + n2`.

**How to read it**: roughly proportional to source-code information content. Below ~200 is trivial; 200–1000 is typical for working code; above 1000 indicates either a function doing too much or a function with many distinct operators/identifiers (e.g. a long cobra command builder, which is unavoidable). Halstead Volume catches density that cyclomatic and cognitive both miss: a long straight-line function with no branches scores 1 on cyclomatic but can have very high Volume.

**Example**:

```bash
$ kyber analyze --metric=halstead ./testdata/complex/

testdata/complex/complex.go
  Branchy   halstead=670.20
```

**Reference**: Halstead, M. H. (1977). [*Elements of Software Science*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halstead_complexity_measures). Elsevier.

### Halstead Difficulty

**Counts**: same token classification as Volume.

**Formula**: `D = (n1 / 2) × (N2 / n2)`. High when there are many distinct operators against few distinct operands — the program manipulates a small data vocabulary in many ways.

**How to read it**: 15 is a reasonable yellow flag for a single function. Useful as a complement to Volume: two functions can have similar Volume but very different Difficulty depending on whether complexity comes from token sprawl (high V, lower D) or operator density (lower V, higher D).

**Example**:

```bash
$ kyber analyze --metric=difficulty ./testdata/complex/

testdata/complex/complex.go
  Branchy   difficulty=25 !
```

**Reference**: Halstead (1977), [same source as Volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halstead_complexity_measures).

### Halstead Effort

**Counts**: same token classification as Volume.

**Formula**: `E = D × V`. Roughly proportional to total mental effort to write or understand the function.

**How to read it**: scales as the product of Difficulty and Volume, so values can be large (10⁴–10⁵ for working code). The standard yellow flag is 10000. Effort is the single most actionable Halstead measure when triaging — it captures both density (D) and total content (V) in one number.

**Example**:

```bash
$ kyber analyze --metric=effort ./testdata/complex/

testdata/complex/complex.go
  Branchy   effort=16754.89 !
```

**Reference**: Halstead (1977), [same source as Volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halstead_complexity_measures).

### Maintainability Index

**Counts**: composite of Halstead Volume, cyclomatic complexity, and effective line count.

**Formula**: `MI = max(0, min(100, (171 − 5.2·ln(V) − 0.23·CC − 16.2·ln(LOC)) × 100/171))`. Normalized to a 0–100 scale; clamped at 0 and 100.

**How to read it**: this is the only metric where **higher is better**. Visual Studio's traffic-light convention: green ≥ 65, yellow 50–64, red < 50. A single function dropping below 65 isn't a crisis; a *package mean* below 65 is. MI is the most useful single-number summary because it composes three orthogonal signals.

**Example**:

```bash
$ kyber analyze --metric=maintainability ./testdata/complex/

testdata/complex/complex.go
  Branchy   maintainability=46.06 !
```

**Reference**: Coleman, D., Ash, D., Lowther, B., & Oman, P. (1994). *Using metrics to evaluate software system maintainability*. IEEE Computer, 27(8). Visual Studio's normalization variant is documented in the [Visual Studio Code Metrics PowerTool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/code-metrics-maintainability-index-range-and-meaning).

### Maximum Nesting Depth

**Counts**: deepest level of nested `*ast.BlockStmt` inside the function body. Each `if`, `for`, `switch case`, or anonymous block adds one level.

**Formula**: walk all `BlockStmt` nodes; return the maximum nesting depth observed.

**How to read it**: depth 1 is the function body itself; 4 is the standard upper bound; depth 5+ is a strong refactoring signal. Often a leading indicator that cognitive complexity is also high.

**Example**:

```bash
$ kyber analyze --metric=nesting ./testdata/nested/

testdata/nested/nested.go
  Nested   nesting=5 !
```

**Reference**: ESLint [max-depth rule](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/max-depth); depth 4 is the widely-cited default.

### Function Length

**Counts**: source lines of the function body, excluding blank lines and lines whose first non-whitespace token is a `//` or `/*` comment.

**Formula**: count lines where the trimmed content is non-empty and does not start with a comment marker.

**How to read it**: 40 is the standard yellow flag and matches `rules/go-conventions.md`. Useful as a standalone gate because Readability bakes length into a composite — promoting it lets a project enforce length without dragging in identifier-length and comment-density signals.

**Example**:

```bash
$ kyber analyze --metric=funclen ./testdata/complex/

testdata/complex/complex.go
  Branchy   funclen=29
```

**Reference**: Fowler, M. (2018). [*Function Length*](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FunctionLength.html). martinfowler.com.

### Return Statement Count

**Counts**: number of `*ast.ReturnStmt` nodes anywhere in the function body. Returns inside nested function literals are not counted (they belong to the inner function).

**Formula**: AST walk with `ast.Inspect`, stopping at `*ast.FuncLit` boundaries.

**How to read it**: 4 is a reasonable yellow flag. Many early returns can be intentional (guard clauses, error handling) or accidental (a function trying to do too much) — the metric leaves the judgment to the threshold rather than baking a heuristic in.

**Example**:

```bash
$ kyber analyze --metric=returns ./testdata/multi_return/

testdata/multi_return/main.go
  Classify   returns=5 !
```

**Reference**: Dijkstra, E. W. (1970). [*Notes on Structured Programming* (EWD249)](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD02xx/EWD249/EWD249.html). The multiple-return debate traces to his structured-programming arguments.

### Readability Score

**Counts**: four 0–1 sub-signals, combined as a weighted average (all weights default to 1):

| Sub-signal | What it measures | Worst at |
|---|---|---|
| Length | function lines vs. 40 | longer functions |
| Nesting | max block depth vs. 4 | deeper nesting |
| Identifier length | median identifier length, with `i`/`j`/`k`/`_`/`ok`/`err` excluded | median below 5 chars |
| Comment density | comment-line ratio, capped at 20% | no comments |

**Formula**: `(w_len·length + w_nest·nesting + w_ident·idents + w_comment·comments) / sum(weights)`.

**How to read it**: 1.0 is ideal; below 0.6 flags. The score is a proxy, not a ground truth — short utility functions can score low simply because they lack comments and use single-letter loop variables. Trust the trend across a package more than any one function's value. (Real academic readability metrics like [Buse-Weimer (2010)](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/p/weimer-tse2010-readability-preprint.pdf) train weights against human ratings; kyber's weights are hand-picked.)

**Example**:

```bash
$ kyber analyze --metric=readability ./testdata/unreadable/

testdata/unreadable/deep.go
  Tangled   readability=0 !
```

**Reference**: Buse, R. P. L., & Weimer, W. R. (2010). [*A metric for software readability*](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/p/weimer-tse2010-readability-preprint.pdf). IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.

### Testability Score

**Counts**: four 0–1 sub-signals, combined as a weighted average (all weights default to 1):

| Sub-signal | What it measures | Worst at |
|---|---|---|
| Parameters | parameter count vs. 5 | high parameter count |
| Side effects | observably-impure calls into `os`/`log`/`http`/`net`/`time`/`fmt` (pure `fmt.Sprintf`/`Errorf`/`Sprint`/`Append*`/`Sscan*` excluded) + reads of package globals, vs. 3 | many I/O calls or global reads |
| Interface params | fraction of parameters whose declared type is an interface | concrete dependencies dominate |
| Length | function lines vs. 40 | longer functions |

**Formula**: `(w_p·params + w_se·sideEffects + w_iface·interfaces + w_len·length) / sum(weights)`.

**How to read it**: 1.0 is ideal; below 0.6 flags. This metric is heuristic, not from published literature — closest published kin is Bruntink & van Deursen (2006), but that operates at class level and doesn't translate to Go functions. Pure `fmt` calls (`Sprintf`, `Errorf`, `Sprint`, `Sprintln`, `Append*`, `Sscan*`) are excluded from the side-effect count; only `Println`/`Printf`/`Fprint*` and other observably-impure functions are counted. Use this as a "watch the trend" signal rather than a strict gate.

**Example**:

```bash
$ kyber analyze --metric=testability ./testdata/untestable/

testdata/untestable/globals.go
  Dispatch   testability=0.20 !
```

**Reference**: Bruntink, M., & van Deursen, A. (2006). [*An empirical study into class testability*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220378137_An_empirical_study_into_class_testability). Journal of Systems and Software, 79(9).

## Reading the report

### Per-function rows

Text output is an aligned table. Each file prints a header row with short metric labels (`mi`, `cog`, `cyc`, `diff`, `effrt`, `fln`, `hal`, `nst`, `npth`, `read`, `ret`, `tst`); every function below uses the same column positions. Maintainability Index (`mi`) is the leftmost metric column. A `!` glued to a value means the score crossed its metric's threshold:

```
                     mi cog cyc  diff   effrt fln  hal nst npth  read ret   tst
  parseDir       48.45!   3   3  18.0  18182.  22 1010.  2    4 0.47!   2 0.45!
```

Findings escalate to **Error** severity at ≥ 2× threshold; in text output the marker is the same `!`, but JSON and SARIF distinguish `warning` vs `error`. The JSON and SARIF formats keep the full metric IDs (`maintainability`, `cyclomatic`, …) — only the human-readable text view uses the short labels.

### `[PACKAGE MEANS]` and `[OVERALL]`

After the per-function detail, kyber prints the mean value of each metric per package and across the whole report. These aggregates always print — they exist to make module-level patterns visible without piping through `jq`.

```
[PACKAGE MEANS]
  internal/adapters/parser    mi=59.84 cog=3.47 cyc=3.53 hal=500.74 read=0.46 tst=0.56   (15 fns)
```

The trailing `(N fns)` is the number of unique functions in that package. The JSON output exposes the same aggregates plus `min`/`max`/`count` in an `aggregates` block.

### Adding a new metric

1. Implement `domain.Metric` in `internal/domain/metrics/<name>.go`
2. Register it in `internal/domain/metrics/all.go`
3. Add a test in `<name>_test.go` (and a `testdata/<fixture>/` package if needed)

That's it.

## Configuration

kyber reads `kyber.toml` from the current directory by default. Precedence (highest first):

1. CLI flags (e.g. `--threshold-cyclomatic=10`)
2. Environment variables (`KYBER_FORMAT`, `KYBER_FAIL_ON_THRESHOLD`, `KYBER_VERBOSE`, `KYBER_PATHS`)
3. `kyber.toml`
4. Built-in defaults

To get started, copy the annotated reference into your project:

```bash
cp kyber.toml.example kyber.toml
```

Every key shown in the example is optional — omit a key to fall back to kyber's built-in default. List only the settings you want to override.

### Top-level keys

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `paths` | array of strings | `["./..."]` | Paths to analyze. Same semantics as positional args to `kyber analyze`. Use Go's `./...` convention to recurse. |
| `exclude` | array of glob strings | `["vendor/**", "testdata/**"]` | Glob patterns matched against each file's path. Files matching any pattern are skipped. |
| `format` | string | `"text"` | Output format: `text`, `json`, or `sarif`. |
| `fail_on_threshold` | bool | `false` | Exit non-zero when any function exceeds a metric threshold. Enable in CI to gate merges; leave off for local exploration. |
| `verbose` | bool | `false` | Emit per-file progress output during the walk. |

### Per-metric tables

Each metric is configured under its own `[metrics.<id>]` table, where `<id>` matches the ID column from `kyber list-metrics`. Every metric supports the same two core keys:

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | Set to `false` to skip the metric entirely. A metric with no `[metrics.<id>]` table is still enabled at its default threshold. |
| `threshold` | number | metric-specific | Value above (or below, for `lower is worse` metrics) which a function is flagged. Setting `0` is equivalent to omitting the key — kyber uses the metric's default. |

Two of the twelve metrics — `readability` and `testability` — accept extra knobs that tune their sub-signals:

#### `[metrics.readability]` extras

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `max_lines` | int | `40` | Function length that scores 0 on the length sub-signal. |
| `max_nesting` | int | `4` | Block nesting depth that scores 0 on the nesting sub-signal. |
| `weight_length` | float | `1.0` | Weight of the length sub-signal in the composite. |
| `weight_nesting` | float | `1.0` | Weight of the nesting sub-signal. |
| `weight_idents` | float | `1.0` | Weight of the identifier-length sub-signal. |
| `weight_comments` | float | `1.0` | Weight of the comment-density sub-signal. |

#### `[metrics.testability]` extras

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `max_params` | int | `5` | Parameter count that scores 0 on the parameter sub-signal. |
| `max_lines` | int | `40` | Function length that scores 0 on the length sub-signal. |
| `weight_params` | float | `1.0` | Weight of the parameter-count sub-signal. |
| `weight_side_effects` | float | `1.0` | Weight of the side-effect sub-signal. |
| `weight_interfaces` | float | `1.0` | Weight of the interface-parameter sub-signal. |
| `weight_length` | float | `1.0` | Weight of the length sub-signal. |

Weights need not sum to 1 — kyber normalizes them by the total before combining sub-signals.

### Environment variables

The following variables override the equivalent `kyber.toml` keys. CLI flags still win over env, and env still wins over `kyber.toml`.

| Variable | Equivalent key | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `KYBER_FORMAT` | `format` | `text` / `json` / `sarif`. |
| `KYBER_FAIL_ON_THRESHOLD` | `fail_on_threshold` | Any value parseable by Go's `strconv.ParseBool` (`true`, `1`, `false`, `0`, …). |
| `KYBER_VERBOSE` | `verbose` | Same parsing as above. |
| `KYBER_PATHS` | `paths` | Comma-separated list, e.g. `KYBER_PATHS=./pkg/...,./cmd/...`. |

## Shell completions

kyber ships a `completion` subcommand that prints a shell-completion script for **bash**, **zsh**, **fish**, or **powershell**. A completion script teaches your shell how to autocomplete kyber commands, subcommands, and flags when you press `<Tab>` — for example, typing `kyber ana<Tab>` expands to `kyber analyze`, and `kyber analyze --form<Tab>` expands to `--format` and offers `text`, `json`, `sarif` as completion candidates.

You only need to run this once per shell, typically from your shell's startup file. After that, completions are loaded automatically with every new shell session.

```bash
# See what's available
kyber completion --help

# Print the script to stdout
kyber completion zsh
```

### Install

**bash**

```bash
# Linux (system-wide, requires bash-completion installed)
kyber completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/kyber > /dev/null

# macOS (Homebrew bash-completion@2)
kyber completion bash > "$(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/kyber"
```

**zsh**

```bash
# Make sure completions are enabled in ~/.zshrc:
#   autoload -U compinit; compinit
kyber completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_kyber"
```

**fish**

```bash
kyber completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/kyber.fish
```

**PowerShell**

```powershell
kyber completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
# To persist, append the above line to your $PROFILE
```

After installing, start a new shell (or `source` the file you wrote) and verify with `kyber <Tab><Tab>` — you should see the subcommand list.

## GitHub Action

Add kyber to any workflow with a single step — no separate install required. The action downloads the correct binary for the runner at runtime.

### Minimal usage

```yaml
- uses: jedi-knights/kyber@v1
  with:
    fail-on-threshold: "true"
```

### SARIF upload (GitHub code scanning)

When `format: sarif`, the action writes a `kyber.sarif` file and uploads it to GitHub code scanning automatically. The results appear in the **Security → Code scanning** tab of your repository.

```yaml
name: Code quality

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  kyber:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      security-events: write   # required for SARIF upload
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: jedi-knights/kyber@v1
        with:
          format: sarif
          fail-on-threshold: "true"
```

Set `upload-sarif: "false"` to produce the SARIF file without uploading it (useful when you want to combine multiple SARIF results before uploading).

### All inputs

| Input | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `paths` | `./...` | Space-separated paths to analyze. Follows Go's `./...` recursion convention. |
| `config` | `kyber.toml` | Path to a `kyber.toml` config file. Silently ignored when the file does not exist. |
| `format` | `text` | Output format: `text`, `json`, or `sarif`. |
| `output` | *(stdout)* | Write the report to a file instead of stdout. |
| `fail-on-threshold` | `false` | Exit non-zero when any function exceeds a metric threshold. Enable in CI to gate merges. |
| `include-tests` | `false` | Include `*_test.go` files in the analysis. |
| `verbose` | `false` | Emit per-file progress output during the walk. |
| `upload-sarif` | `true` | Upload the SARIF report to GitHub code scanning. Only active when `format: sarif`. |

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jedi-knights/kyber.git
cd kyber
go mod download
go test -race -count=1 ./...
git config core.hooksPath .githooks    # enable pre-push linting
```

Useful Makefile targets: `make build`, `make test`, `make lint`, `make install`, `make run`, `make clean`.

## Contributing

Bug reports and PRs are welcome. Run `make test` and `make lint` locally before pushing. Conventional Commits (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, ...) drive the release pipeline — non-conformant commits are rejected by CI.
